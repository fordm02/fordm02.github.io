## Data Science

### [Eat4Genes](https://olyerickson.shinyapps.io/Eat4Genes/)
After my team preprepared a dataset from a list of studies curated by an expert biologist, I built an interactive user interace using R Shiny for users to find reccomended nutreints based on key gene expression. [Github](https://github.rpi.edu/DataINCITE/Eat4Genes)

Eat4Genes is a prototype diet recommendation web app for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers that aids in the selection of a healthy diet to help treat and prevent numerous health conditions. Our approach is focused on the strategic use of diet to regulate key risk gene expression, which we call dietary rational gene targeting (DRGT).

Using public source data, I examined the relationship between different variables across real world data from multiple sources. I created SVM, Linear Regression, KNN, and Random Forest models to predict trends in communities. [Github](https://github.com/fordm02/fooddeserts)

Using KNN, SVM, and  Random Forest models, I predicted wine quality based on characteristics. I also predict bank transcation outcomes using previous interactions and other characteristics. [Github](https://github.rpi.edu/fordm2/DataAnalytics2022_MorganFord/tree/main/Assignment%207)

### New York Housing Assignment

I used KNN to classify the tax class at time of sale and I ran a random forest model to try to form a regression model for the price of the units. [Github](https://github.rpi.edu/fordm2/DataAnalytics2022_MorganFord/tree/main/Assignment%204)

## Machine Learning

### Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network for Classifying Coronavirus NLP Data
Using Coronavirus tweets, I used a Mutlilayter Perceptron Neutral Network to perform sentiment analysis. [Github](https://github.com/fordm02/corona-nlp-project)
