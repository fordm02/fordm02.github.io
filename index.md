After my team preprepared a dataset from a list of studies curated by an expert biologist, I built an interactive user interface using R Shiny for users to find reccomended nutreints based on key gene expression. I also contributed to a paper that we submitted to ACM-BCB, which has not yet been accepted. [Github](https://github.rpi.edu/DataINCITE/Eat4Genes)

Eat4Genes is a prototype diet recommendation web app for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers that aids in the selection of a healthy diet to help treat and prevent numerous health conditions. Our approach is focused on the strategic use of diet to regulate key risk gene expression, which we call dietary rational gene targeting (DRGT).

## Data Analytics

### US Food Desertâ€™s Demographics, Food Access, and Disease Prevalence
[![Open Research Poster](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Research_Poster-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](pdf/DataAnalytics_A6Poster_Morgan_Ford_6000.pdf)

Using public source data, I examined the relationship between different variables across real world data from multiple sources. I created SVM, Linear Regression, KNN, and Random Forest models to predict trends in communities. [Github](https://github.com/fordm02/fooddeserts)

23.5 million Americans live in food deserts[1](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45014/30940_err140.pdf). Many Americans also live with diet related health conditions. This poster will examine a potential relationship between access to grocery stores and access to healthy foods at grocery stores, the differences between urban and non-urban food deserts, the relationship between population demographics and food deserts, and the relationship between food deserts and the prevalence or mortality rates of diet-related health conditions. I hypothesis that food deserts are less likely to have a variety of healthy foods in their limited food sources compared to areas that are not food deserts. I also hypothesize that food desert communities are more likely to be at risk for diet related health issues than than areas that are not food deserts. By t-test alone, my hypothesis is disproven. However, from the models that I have generated, I find there to be a significant link between food deserts, food access, quality of life, and diet-related health conditions.


### Bank Interaction And Wine Quality Prediction Assignment

[![Open Assignment Document](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Assignment_Document-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](https://github.rpi.edu/fordm2/DataAnalytics2022_MorganFord/blob/main/Assignment%207/DA_Assignment_7.pdf)

Using KNN, SVM, and  Random Forest models, I predicted wine quality based on characteristics. I also predict bank transcation outcomes using previous interactions and other characteristics. [Github](https://github.rpi.edu/fordm2/DataAnalytics2022_MorganFord/tree/main/Assignment%207)

### New York Housing Assignment

I used KNN to classify the tax class at time of sale and I ran a random forest model to try to form a regression model for the price of the units. [Github](https://github.rpi.edu/fordm2/DataAnalytics2022_MorganFord/tree/main/Assignment%204)

## Machine Learning

### Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network for Classifying Coronavirus NLP Data

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://github.com/fordm02/corona-nlp-project/blob/main/Project.ipynb) [![Open Project Writeup](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Project_Writeup-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/fordm02/corona-nlp-project/blob/main/Multilayer_Perceptron_Neural_Netword_for_Classifying_Coronavirus_NLPData.pdf)

Using Coronavirus tweets, I used a Mutlilayter Perceptron Neutral Network to perform sentiment analysis. [Github](https://github.com/fordm02/corona-nlp-project)

Many kinds of information has been circulated on the internet during the coronavirus pandemic, especially on Twitter. It is important to be able to get a sense of how the population is feeling about the current situation of the pandemic and current events as the status of the pandemic continuously changes. By examining tweets, I have created a Multilayer Perceptron Model that can correctly classify tweets as being positive, negative, or neutral in sentiment with 80.4% accuracy.
